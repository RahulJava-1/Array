# Array
Array is the collection of similar data type. Which can store data simultaneously. It a linear data structure and stores the data linearly in memory. Lets take a example – Whenever we want to work with large number of data values, we need to use that much number of different variables. As the number of variables increasing, complexity of program also increases and programming gets confused with variable names. There may be situations in which we need to work with large no. of similar data values. To make the work more easy. C language provides a concept of “Array”.
“An array is a variable which can store multiple values of same data type at a time.”

Declaration of an Array- When we declare an array the we need to declare first its data type that’s means which type of data you need to store in your array. Second is what’s the name of your array then declare its size.

<datatype> <array_name>[size];

like that – int arr[10];
delclaration of 2D array:-
  int arr[][];
Here is the Example of 2D array. With the help of 2D array we can figure out addition, multiplication and transpose in the form of matrix.
